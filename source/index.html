        <h1 id="title">1908 Page Long Solution to the Collatz Conjecture</h1>
        <p>For ages, the Collatz Conjecture has been left unsolved. <br>
            The conjecture states: if a number is even, divide it by 2. If a number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. <br>
            After repeating this pattern, you'll notice that eventually the number because 4, then 2, then 1, and then 4 again. And the pattern repeats. <br>
